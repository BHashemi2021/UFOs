## Overview

The objective of this undertaking is to prepare a webpage in JavaScript language to display UFO sightings and related information for the upcoming gathering of UFO enthusiasts in McMinnville, Oregon.


### The purpose 
  
  1- As the data file is reltively a big one, we need to design filters so that users could search the data they wish by a few keywords provided.
  
  2- The filters need to be reset so that the next user could perform a fresh search.

##  Results
The webpage is ready for use and the users could enter their keywords and retrieve the intended results (Figure 1)

  --------------------------
  
The search windows could be easily cleared from previous searches by an acive text on the right upper corner of the webpage (Figue 2).

## Summary

  1- One draback of this webpage is that the reset button is rather obscure and one needs to look for it.
  
  2- All the data is loaded when the webpage is run for the first time.

  3- The webpage could be further improved if the users could print out or email their search results.
